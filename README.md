# Reduced-Order Modelling for combustion data sets

This is a collection of Matlab tools for performing a general Reduced-Order Modelling on data sets. Many of the functions presented here can be used universally on data sets coming from various disciplines but the main focus was to apply the techniques to combustion data sets and hence some methods will be combustion-specific.

The general methodology for the usage of functions in this repository is presented on the graph below:
